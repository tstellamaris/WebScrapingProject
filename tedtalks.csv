"The story of 'Oumuamua, the first visitor from another star system","In October 2017, astrobiologist Karen J. Meech got the call every astronomer waits for: NASA had spotted the very first visitor from another star system. The interstellar comet — a half-mile-long object eventually named `Oumuamua, from the Hawaiian for ""scout"" or ""messenger"" — raised intriguing questions: Was it a chunk of rocky debris from a new star system, shredded material from a supernova explosion, evidence of alien technology or something else altogether? In this riveting talk, Meech tells the story of how her team raced against the clock to find answers about this unexpected gift from afar.","astronomy, extraterrestrial life, exploration, NASA, nature, science, universe, space, asteroid, astrobiology",April 2018,804.0,4321522,21,en | fa | tr | pt-BR | it | es | ru | sr | fr | hu | th | zh-Hans | el | he | ar | nl | pl | zh-Hant | pt | ko | ja,Karen J.

The result: striking garments in non-traditional fabrics like kente cloth, camouflage and silk that confront the normalization of systemic racism in the US.

Prepare to be dazzled by a dreamy, swirling array of flying machines as they dance like fireflies above the TED stage.","beauty, creativity, demo, drones, design, future, invention, technology, flight",February 2016,695.0,4899848,26,el | en | vi | it | ar | pt-BR | es | ru | nl | pt | zh-Hant | tr | zh-Hans | th | ro | pl | fr | de | hu | fa | ja | he | sr | ko | uk | hr,Raffaello D'Andrea,Autonomous systems pioneer,"Raffaello D'Andrea explores the possibilities of autonomous technology by collaborating with artists, engineers and entrepreneurs.",66
What the discovery of gravitational waves means,"More than a billion years ago, two black holes in a distant galaxy locked into a spiral, falling inexorably toward each other, and collided. ""All that energy was pumped into the fabric of time and space itself,"" says theoretical physicist Allan Adams, ""making the universe explode in roiling waves of gravity."" About 25 years ago, a group of scientists built a giant laser detector called LIGO to search for these kinds of waves, which had been predicted but never observed. In this mind-bending talk, Adams breaks down what happened when, in September 2015, LIGO detected an unthinkably small anomaly, leading to one of the most exciting discoveries in the history of physics.","astronomy, cosmos, curiosity, exploration, nature, physics, science, technology, universe, space",February 2016,658.0,2569622,33,el | en | vi | it | ar | pt-BR | cs | es | ru | nl | pt | zh-Hant | tr | zh-Hans | th | ro | pl | be | fr | bg | hr | de | hu | fa | fi | ja | he | ka | sr | ko | sv | my | lv,Allan Adams,Theoretical physicist,"Allan Adams is a theoretical physicist working at the intersection of fluid dynamics, quantum field theory and string theory.",176
